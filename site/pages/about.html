        Millbrook Construction WA is a construction company based halfway between Albany and Denmark, in the Great Southern of Western Australia. We specialise in residential construction with a high-end finish and attention to detail.<br><br>

        We appreciate both excellent design and quality craftsmanship. Specialising in timber-framed homes, we love working with our clients to create unique and custom projects. The versatility that timber offers in terms of flexibility and speed of construction is why we love utilising this building technique.<br><br>

        We are passionate about passive designs and using construction materials to improve this further where possible. We always look to utilise the latest products for our clients that are both cost-effective and efficient.<br><br>

        If you want to learn more about Millbrook Construction WA and would like to view some of the recent projects we have worked on, feel free to contact our founder, Michael Sullivan.
